Dr. Fichera was awarded a new research grant by the National Science Foundation (NSF), entitled
[_Unified Design, Modeling, and Control of Extensible Continuum Robots for Operation in Human Workspaces_][1]. 
This collaborative project will see our lab work with Drs. Cagdas Onal (PI) and Berk Calli
to develop a highly flexible robotic arm called CoBRA (Continuum Bioinspired Robotic Assistant) to help people with daily tasks and improve their independent living skills.
