# Abstract
This letter describes the manufacturing and experimental characterization of novel stretchable strain sensors for continuum robots. The overarching goal of this research is to provide a new solution for the shape sensing of these devices. The sensors are fabricated via direct ink writing, an extrusionbased additive manufacturing technique. Electrically conductive material (i.e., the ink) is printed into traces whose electrical resistance varies in response to mechanical deformation. The principle of operation of stretchable strain sensors is analogous to that of conventional strain gauges, but with a significantly larger operational window thanks to their ability to withstand larger strain. Among the different conductive materials considered for this study, we opted to fabricate the sensors with a high-viscosity eutectic Gallium-Indium ink, which in initial testing exhibited high linearity (R2 ≈ 0.99), gauge factor ≈ 1, and negligible drift. Benefits of the proposed sensors include (i) ease of fabrication, as they can be conveniently printed in a matter of minutes; (ii) ease of installation, as they can simply be glued to the outside body of a robot; and (iii) ease of miniaturization, which enables integration into millimeter-sized continuum robots.
