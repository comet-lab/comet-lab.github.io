# Abstract
Palpation is used by surgeons to examine a patientâ€™s body
and build a mental map of their anatomy and its properties
(e.g., tissue stiffness) in preparation for a procedure. In this
paper, we propose an analogous technique for laser
surgery: We call this technique Virtual Palpation as it does
not involve actual physical contact with the tissue. Instead,
the tissue properties of interest are inferred based on the
observation of the thermal response to laser pulses.
